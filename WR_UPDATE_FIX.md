# WR Update Script Fix

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow for updating WR (World Record) data was failing with:
```
IndexError: list index out of range
```

This occurred in `wr-python/src/wr_python/LeaderBoard.py` when trying to access scraped elements from a Google Sheets document.

## Root Cause
The script was scraping a public Google Sheets document using CSS selectors (`s34` and `s42`), but:
1. The Google Sheets HTML structure may have changed
2. The CSS classes might have been updated
3. Network issues could prevent proper scraping
4. The script had no error handling for missing data

## Solution
Added comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms:

### 1. Bounds Checking
- `__gettime()` method now checks array bounds before accessing elements
- Returns "0" as default when index is out of range
- Prevents IndexError crashes

### 2. URL Extraction Protection
- `_get_url()` method validates element existence before accessing href
- Returns empty string when no link is found
- Handles missing anchor tags gracefully

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Added logging to show scraping results
- Reports found element counts and available CSS classes
- Helps diagnose scraping issues

### 4. Graceful Fallback
- Script continues even when LeaderBoard initialization fails
- Uses default values (0 times, empty URLs) when data unavailable
- Ensures track.js file is always generated

### 5. Individual Track Error Handling
- Wraps each track processing in try-catch
- Continues processing other tracks when one fails
- Maintains script completion even with partial failures

## Result
- GitHub Actions workflow no longer crashes
- Always generates valid track.js file
- Discord bot continues functioning with default data when scraping fails
- Improved maintainability and reliability
